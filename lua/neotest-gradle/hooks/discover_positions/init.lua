--- See Neotest adapter specification.
---
--- It uses the Neotest provided utilities to run Treesitter queries. These
--- queries find (nested) test classes as Neotest namespaces and test functions
--- as Neotest tests. Other positions like "file" and "dir" are not supported
--- and are handled differently during execution.
---
--- Referred context functions help to provide good readable test names for UI
--- and construct test identifiers based on Java paths used during execution.
---
--- @param path string - absolute file path
--- @return neotest.Tree
